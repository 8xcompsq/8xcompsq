Founded in November 2019 8X Computing Squad aims to provide open-source software solutions and reliable hardware ones.
It is really just Incogninto1-1 (the one who is writing this description) for now and I am still learning some stuff along the way.
This is just my resume/practice sandbox for code 'n stuff.
When I want to do something that I find interesting I put it up here. It's mostly going to be open-source Linux stuff and maybe some low level code here and there.
I like to work on lower level stuff like kernels, bootloaders, initr systems and the like. Maybe game engines if I need to (foreshadowing).
If you want to ask something about 8X Computing Squad you can send me an email to 8xcomputing@gmail.com (Email works but I might change it in the future)
If you want to talk to me about other stuff send me an email to incogninto123@gmail.com
